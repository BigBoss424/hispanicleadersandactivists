# hispanicleadersandactivists

A website that I will be building and hosting on Github for Hispanic Heritage Month.

I will be building using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Goals

To build the site using the template that is given to me from a JavaScript tutorial I have worked on previously to build the site itself.

Organize the data using JSON, and add more leaders to the leaders array and create a activists array.
